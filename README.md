# Algorithmic Methods of Data Mining Homeworks

## Homework 2

The homework was divided in 3 sections:

1. The first one in which we had to answer to some RQs on a [kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shmalex/instagram-dataset) about **instagram_profiles.csv**, **instagram_locations.csv**, **instagram_posts.csv**.
2. A Command Line Question about the **instagram_posts.csv**.
3. Some Algorithmic Questions.
